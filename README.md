# Daniel's minimal PCLP VS Code configuration

**I've created this repo for easy setup of a PCLP environment in Visual Studio Code**

> If you need help ask me or ChatGPT (same thing anyway :))

It includes things like:

- *autosave* (so you don't cry if you close your computer)
- *formatter* (so the checker doesn't cry that you didn't put the {} right)
- *debugger configuration* - you must learn how to use the debugger for pclp btw because you can see the values of your variables and examine what's wrong with your code and spend less time bug hunting (search on youtube or annoy @alin1popa for more debugging demos)

## Recommendation

Check out the config files above ^^^ and ask or search things you don't understand. ChatGPT is your friend. Tweak them so you can feel confident in your evironment. Break things, explore, almost everything is reversible.

## How to clone this repository to your computer:

If you haven't already, install git:
```bash
dyno@ragnarok:~$ sudo apt update
dyno@ragnarok:~$ sudo apt install git -y
```
```bash
dyno@ragnarok:~$ git clone https://github.com/DynoW/pclp-vscode.git && cd ./pclp-vscode
```

## How to check for updates:
```bash
dyno@ragnarok:~/pclp-vscode$ git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```
If you see different output, you probably have to do a $ `git pull`


## Structure:

```text
pclp-vscode
├── README.md <- this file you are reading
├── .clang-format <- the coding style that the PCLP checker uses (Linux Kernel)
├── .editorconfig <- extra config for vscode
└── .vscode
    ├── launch.json <- launch options for debugger
    ├── settings.json <- workspace setting of vscode
    └── tasks.json <- autogenerated compile tasks for C compiler

2 directories, 6 files
```
Feel free to change the config files and extensions as you like

## How to use these files:

**Move them to your pclp directory where you have preferably a labs and a homework directory**

(you can skip the README.md)


```text
pclp
├── README.md
├── .clang-format
├── .editorconfig
├── labs
│   ├── lab1
│   ├── lab2
│   ├── lab3
│   ├── lab4
│   └── lab5
├── teme
│   ├── tema0
│   └── tema1
└── .vscode
    ├── launch.json
    ├── settings.json
    └── tasks.json
```

## Extensions:
- `C/C++ Extension Pack` by Microsoft (it installs C/C++, themes and CMake Tools)
- `Makefile Tools` by Microsoft
- `Error Lens` by Alexander
- `vscode-pdf` by tomoki1207
- `EditorConfig` for VS Code by EditorConfig
- `Better Comments` by Aaron Bond (optional)
- `Excalidraw` by pomdtr (optional - whiteboard for making schemes of algorithms)

## Setup formatter:

In VS Code, open a .c file and press `CTRL+SHIFT+P` and type: Format Document With... > Configure Default Formatter... > C/C++

This should set it as the default formatter. Now you can use the same steps and select 'Format Document' (or just press CTRL+S).

## How to run code?
Just press the triangle with the bug in the top right.

![screenshot-1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DynoW/images/refs/heads/main/pclp-vscode/screenshot-1.png)

You will see the output of the program in the `Terminal` tab at the bottom.

You can use breakpoints by clicking on the lines. You should see a red dot there. That is where your program will pause and let you inspect variables in the panel on the right. (you can see in the example n = 10)

![screenshot-2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DynoW/images/refs/heads/main/pclp-vscode/screenshot-2.png)

The reason you don't see any output is because the yellow line hasn't executed yet. You can continue execution of the program untill next breakpoint with the first option in the floating window that appeared. With the last option (red square stops the program)

## Shortcuts I use daily:

- `CTRL + /` - comment in/out current line
- `CTRL + S` - format file with the default formatter
- `CTRL + [` and `CTRL + ]` - to change indentation of line or multiple lines
- `CTRL + F` - find text in current file
- `CTRL + P` - open a file
- `CTRL + SHIFT + P` - command palette
- `CTRL + TAB` - change between tabs

Less used but still useful sometimes:

- `CTRL + B` - show/hide explorer
- `CTRL + SHIFT + F` - show/hide search
- `CTRL +` `` ` `` - to show/hide terminal

#### Extra for advanced users that use git windows & linux: (ignore if you don't develop on windows)

On Windows (convert LF -> CRLF on checkout, CRLF -> LF on commit)
`git config --global core.autocrlf true`

On Linux/macOS users (don't touch line endings, keep LF)
`git config --global core.autocrlf input`


```bash
dyno@ragnarok:~/pclp$ nano .gitattributes

```
```text
# Set default behavior for text files
* text=auto
```
(CTRL+X and Y to save)
```bash
dyno@ragnarok:~/pclp$ git add --renormalize .
dyno@ragnarok:~/pclp$ git commit -m "Normalize line endings"

```
