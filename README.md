# Daniel's minimal PCLP vscode configuration

I've created this repo for easy setup of a pclp environment in Visual Studio Code

If you need help ask me or ChatGPT (same thing anyway :))

It includes things like:

- autosave
- formatter (so the checker doesn't cry that you didn't put the {} right)
- debugger configuration - you must learn how to use the debugger for pclp btw because you can see the values of your variables and examine what's wrong with your code and spend less time bug hunting (search on youtube or annoy @alin1popa for more degugging demos)

## How to clone this repository to your computer:

If you haven't already, install git
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git -y
```
```bash
dyno@ragnarok:~$ git clone https://github.com/DynoW/pclp-vscode.git && cd ./pclp-vscode
```

## How to check for updates:
```bash
dyno@ragnarok:~/pclp-vscode$ git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```
If you see different output, you probably have to do a $ `git pull`


## Structure:

```text
pclp-vscode
├── README.md <- this file you are reading
├── .clang-format <- the coding style that the pclp checker uses (Linux Kernel)
├── .editorconfig <- extra config for vscode
└── .vscode
    ├── launch.json <- launch options for debugger
    ├── settings.json <- workspace setting of vscode
    └── tasks.json <- autogenerated compile tasks for C compiler

2 directories, 6 files
```
Feel free to change the config files and extensions as you like

## How to use these files:

> Move them to your pclp directory where you have preferrably a labs and a homework direcory

(you can skip the README.md)


```text
pclp
├── README.md
├── .clang-format
├── .editorconfig
├── labs
│   ├── lab1
│   ├── lab2
│   ├── lab3
│   ├── lab4
│   └── lab5
├── teme

└── .vscode
    ├── launch.json

```

## Extensions:
- `C/C++ Extension Pack` by Microsoft (it installs C/C++, themes and CMake Tools)
Makefile Tools by Microsoft

- `Error Lens` by Alexander

- `vscode-pdf` by tomoki1207

- `EditorConfig` for VS Code by EditorConfig

- `Better Comments` by Aaron Bond (optional)

- `Excalidraw` by pomdtr (optional - whiteboard for making schemes of algorithms)

## Setup formatter:

In VSCode, open a .c file and press `CTRL+SHIFT+P` and type Format Document With... > Configure Default Formatter... > C/C++

Tthis should make it default formatter. Now you can use same combination and select Format Document (or just press `CTRL+S`)

#### Extra for advanced users that use git windows & linux: (ignore if you don't develop on windows)

On Windows (convert LF -> CRLF on checkout, CRLF -> LF on commit)
`git config --global core.autocrlf true`

On Linux/macOS users (don't touch line endings, keep LF)
`git config --global core.autocrlf input`


```bash
dyno@ragnarok:~/pclp$ nano .gitattributes

```
```text
# Set default behavior for text files
* text=auto
```
(CTRL+X and Y to save)
```bash
dyno@ragnarok:~/pclp$ git add --renormalize .
dyno@ragnarok:~/pclp$ git commit -m "Normalize line endings"

```
